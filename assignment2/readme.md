<h1> What is the Version control System and Why is it Important? </h1>
<br>
<h2>Version Control System records changes that was made to a file or a batch of them over time so it's easy to recall previous versions later. Just so in case a new version of a file has a bug you can go back to the previous version. This can be done with any computer. It's also very handy to have if you are doing web-design where there is a lot of trial and error.</h2>
