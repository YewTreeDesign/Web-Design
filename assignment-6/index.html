        <p>I teach you the overman. Man is something that shall be overcome. What have you done to overcome him? <br>
     All beings so far have created something beyond themselves; and do you want to be the ebb of this great flood and even go back to the beasts rather than overcome man? What is the ape to man? A laughingstock or a painful embarrassment. And man shall be just that for the overman: a laughingstock or a painful embarrassment...‚Äù</p>

        <p> Behold, I teach you the overman. The overman is the meaning of the earth.Let your will say: the overman shall be the meaning of the earth! I beseech you, my brothers, remain faithful to the earth, and do not believe those who speak to you of otherworldly hopes! Poison-mixers are they, whether they know it or not. Despisers of life are they, decaying and poisoned themselves, of whom the earth is weary: so let them go.
     Once the sin against God was the greatest sin; but God died, and these sinners died with him. To sin against the earth is now the most dreadful thing, and to esteem the entrails of the unknowable higher than the meaning of the earth...
     What is the greatest experience you can have? It is the hour of the great contempt. The hour when your happiness, too, arouses your disgust, and even your reason and your virtue.</p>

        <p>The hour when you say, <span class="spoken">
          <br>'What matters my happiness? It is poverty and filth and wretched contentment. But my happiness ought to justify existence itself.'</span></p>

        <p>The hour when you say,<span class="spoken"><br>'What matters my reason? Does it crave knowledge as the lion his food? It is poverty and filth and wretched contentment.'</span>
      
        <br><p>The hour when you say, <span class="spoken"> <br>'The hour when you say, 'What matters my virtue? As yet it has not made me rage.<br>
             How weary I am of my good and my evil! All that is poverty and filth and wretched contentment.'</span></p>

        <p id="first-offer"><span class="spoken">'Man is a rope, tied between beast and overman--a rope over an abyss...'</span> <br>
          <span class="spoken">'What is great in man is that he is a bridge and not an end: what can be loved in man is that he is an overture and a going under...'</span></p>
