B.) Briefly share your design process for this assignment. What fonts did you choose, and why?<br>

<b> I was experimenting more with the lay out of the type faces and other effects I could add to the mix.<br>
I also used Railway and Arial fonts because they are easier to read on a web page.</b>
<br>
<br>

C.) What is the difference between a system font, web font, and web-safe font? What is the importance of having fallback fonts or a font stack?<br>

<b> system fonts are from your computer, web fonts can also be on a computer but it's also streamlined on the internet, Web-safe fonts are preloaded fonts included <br>
with in many OS. The importance of having the fall back fonts are just incase if one of your fonts fail due to a connection issue, you would still be able to Read
the content</b>
<br>
<br>

D.) Summarize your work cycle for this assignment. Review this page if you need some ideas.<br>

    <b>I have played around with how the title is layed out. I also added a glow to the text.
    What I tried to do is have the U and the H huge but I found that a little tricky to do. I am content with how it turned out.</b>
