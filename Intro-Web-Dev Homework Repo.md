Why I have decided to take this class is because I want to learn more about web design. I have a basic knowledge of HTML5 and Java but I would like to learn how to implement it to
make a website pleasing aesthetically and functional. I have created websites with Word Press but I would like to learn how to create my own themes, layout and everything without using other people's assets. That's what I hope to get out of this class.

What I have Learned about the Internet. I have already learned most of this stuff in Digital Technology but here are somethings I found interesting.
<ul>
  <li>How the Internet was many times compared to the Ocean, rather than just a "web"</li>
  <li>How Far we came from AOL</li>
  <li>How the internet is becoming more and more physical</li>
</ul>
