<br><h4>A.) Briefly describe the difference between divs, classes, ids, and spans</h4>

<br>The differences are that divs are block elements, used for styling in the HTML5 with out creating a separate Custom Style Sheet (CSS).
<br>Spans are inline. It contains content in big blocks on the page.
<br>Ids are identifiers. They uniquely identifies an element.
<br>
<br><h4>B.) What is "alt text," and why do we use it?</h4>
<br>
<br>Alt is used to give a description of an image, incase if the image isn't showing up on the browser or for the visually impaired.
<br>
<br<h4>C.) Summarize your work cycle for this assignment</h4>
<br>  All I have done was followed the instructions provided on the Moodle, I used iFrame and Source elements to represent the media on the page.
I can't wait till we start doing CSS so the code wouldn't be so congested with a lot of Div element. Yet I have found learning Divs essential because there are some<br>
classes that CSS won't be able to read and just ignore it.<br>
<br>I couldn't get a free/safe copy of the song so I just shared the song from my iTunes... It only previews <br>
1:30 of it.
