  I would like to leave this city<br>
  This old town don't smell too pretty and<br>
  I can feel the warning signs running around my mind<br>
  And when I leave this island I'll book myself into a soul asylum<br>
  'Cause I can feel the warning signs running around my mind<br>
<br>
  So here I go, I'm still scratching around in the same old hole<br>
  My body feels young but my mind is very old<br>
  So what do you say?<br>
  You can't give me the dreams that are mine anyway<br>
  Half the world away, half the world away<br>
  Half the world away<br>
  I've been lost, I've been found but I don't feel down<br>
<br>
  And when I leave this planet<br>
  You know I'd stay but I just can't stand it and<br>
  I can feel the warning signs running around my mind<br>
  And if I could leave this spirit<br>
  I'll find me a hole and I will live in it and<br>
  I can feel the warning signs running around my mind<br>
<br>
  Here I go, I'm still scratching around in the same old hole<br>
  My body feels young but my mind is very old<br>
  So what do you say?<br>
  You can't give me the dreams that are mine anyway<br>
  Half the world away, half the world away<br>
  Half the world away<br>
  I've been lost, I've been found but I don't feel down<br>
<br>
  No, I don't feel down<br>
  No, I don't feel down<br>
  I don't feel down<br>
  I don't feel down<br>
  Don't feel down<br>
  I don't feel down<br>
