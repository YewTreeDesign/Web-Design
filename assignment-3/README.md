<h4> Structural v Semantic Markups</h4><br>
<li> Structural markups are what effect the flow of a webpage and Semantic Markups are what brings more emphasis on elements</li><br>
<h4> What Have I done? </h4><br>
<li> All I have done is made a very cut and dry website with information of a recipe for java chip muffins. I worked with meta elements and some markup elements.<br>
I have also linked another page through the nav elements. I stuck with the instructions presented on the Moodle website.
